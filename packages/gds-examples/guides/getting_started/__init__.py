"""Build Your First Model — progressive tutorial for the GDS framework.

Start with stage1_minimal and work through each stage in order.
Each stage builds on the previous one, using a thermostat/heater system
as the running example.

Stages:
    1. stage1_minimal    — Your first GDS model (entity, blocks, compose, spec)
    2. stage2_feedback   — Adding feedback (Policy, loop, richer composition)
    3. stage3_dsl        — Using the gds-control DSL (same model, fewer lines)
    4. stage4_verify_viz — Verification and visualization
    5. stage5_query      — Querying your specification
